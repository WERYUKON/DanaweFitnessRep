To run the app, install dependencies on the backend and frontend folders using cmd, in the appropriate directory.
This can be done by using cd path/, and npm install.
After this, use cd path/backend(to path to backend folder), and use "npm start" to get the local server running.
Then path/frontend , and run npm run dev, to get front end running. Copy the localhost5713 (or other) link into browser for use.
Obs: Do not clone repository into a Onedrive path, as npm install will take ages to install.
