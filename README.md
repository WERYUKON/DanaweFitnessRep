Do not clone repository into a Onedrive path, as dependencies will take ages to install.
Also, make sure to have the most recent version of node.js installed (version Node.js v24.11.1).

To run the app, install dependencies on the backend and frontend folders using cmd, in the cloned repository directory.
This can be done by using cd "path/cloned rep/backend" and cd "path/cloned rep/frontend" in cmd, and typing npm install in each folder(This will install node_modules that would be too large to add to the repository).
After this, use cd "path/cloned rep/backend"(to path to backend folder), and use "npm start" to get the local server running.
Then path/frontend , and run npm run dev, to get front end running. Copy the "localhost5713" (or other) link into browser for use.
